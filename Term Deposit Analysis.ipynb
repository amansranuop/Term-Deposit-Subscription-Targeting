    "### Problem Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "This bank currently has a low number of customers that are subscribed to term deposits. Term deposits are beneficial for the bank because they provide a stable source of predictable cash flow, funding, as well as profit opportunities for the bank by allowing them to lend to other banks at a higher interest rate. Term deposit also reduce the risk of sudden withdrawals, which also supports its customer retention through attractive rates, and help manages interest rate fluctuations. Increasing the number of term deposits will enable the bank to enhance liquidity management and improve overall profitability. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to increase the number of clients subscribing to long term deposits. This will be done by identifying the characteristics of clients who are most likely to subscribe. Characteristics such as job, education, balance, marital status, age, etc. This benefits the bank because it targets its marketing efforts more effectively such as offering personalized incentives (higher interest rates) to clients to maximize their subscription rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bank resources such as marketing can optimize their efforts by focusing on clients that are most likely to subscribe.It improves the converstion rates for term deposits. By having more term deposit subscriptions, it increases the bank's cash flow stability. \n"

    "#### Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Age:** This shows that the bank currently have customers of different age groups. Minimum of 18 year olds, Maximum of 95, and a mean of 40 year olds. Older customers might be inclined more towards invesments such as term deposits while the younger age group might need more incentives such as education.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Balance:** With a maximum of $100,000+ balance and a minimum of a negative balance, it can be understood that the bank has a large variation in customers. The ones with a higher balance will more likely be interested in term deposits in compared to the ones with low balance, might be less interested or need more incentive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Day**: The average day value shows 15.85. It is the day of the month that the customer was last contacted. It could help the call center/marketing team to analyze if there is perhaps a certain time of the month when a client is more open to bank offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duration:** The mean shows an average of 255 seconds per phone call. Maximum of 4918 seconds. Longer calls shows more interest in subscribing to long term deposits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Campaign**: The mean shows that customers were contacted approximately 2.8 times in their current campaign. It shows that repeated attemps are common. However, it is helpful to understand the optimal number of attemps without having a negative impact in customers experience that could lead to them declining term deposit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**pdays:** The negative indicates that the customers were not contacted and the mean shows on average a customer wasn't contacted in 34 days. This shows that their is room to call customer and engage them in the incentive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**previous:** The average is low. Showing a customer has not been contacted multiple times, again shows that their are customers who can be called.\n",

    "**Weak Correlation:** The heatmap shows a weak correlation between age and balance. It means that older customers with higher balance are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Positive Correlation:** There’s a moderately positive correlation between duration and other variables, such as previous. It could imply that longer calls are associated with higher customer engagement, potentially increasing the likelihood of a term deposit subscription. It is helpful to understand customer engagement.\n",

    "\n",
    "Targetting older customers who tend to have a higher balance could be beneficial for term deposit marketing. The marketing team can tailor more incentives and benefits for the older customer to engage them more into subscription. Longer calls with customers shows higher interest in term deposit. Therefore, focusing on these customers in future calls could improve subscription rates. "

    "The analysis of \"Term Deposit Subscription Targeting\" and model provides a targeted approach for the bank to increase term deposit subscriptions by identifying customer base that is most likely to subscribe. The analysis explored the correlation between different variables. It showed correlation between age and balance. It means that older customers with higher balance are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit. To better understand customer engagement, the heatmap showed moderately positive correlation between duration and other variables, such as previous. It could imply that longer calls are associated with higher customer engagement, potentially increasing the likelihood of a term deposit subscription. Further analysis also determined, age alone doesn't play much of a factor in understanding a customers incenstive to term deposit. There is a significant difference between bank balance when it comes to term deposit. This is because higher bank balance have more financial security and are able to invest for their future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon building a random forest model with a custom threshold of 0.3, it received an accuracy of 91%. We also recieved a high recall of 66%. This captures a majority of potential subscribers, which aligns with banks's objective to expand more term deposit. In this analysis, we also learned the top factors that influence subscription liklehood. Factors such as customer engagement (longer phone duration) and financial security. For customer segmentation, Low 7382: These are customers with a low likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit. Medium 1,387 customers: These customers have a moderate likelihood of subscribing. High 83 customers: This small group has a high likelihood of subscribing."

    "My recommendation for the bank would be to prioritize their customers with high probability. By focusing on this, the marketing resources are being used fully and correctly. Focusing marketing efforts on high segment customers by offering attractive deals/incentives. This could included sign up bonuses, high interest rates or even as small as offering sign up gifts. The segment is small but it is highly likely to convert, which makes it the most valuable target. For its customers with medium probability, use cost effective marketing strategies such as email campaigns and personalized offers to get their interest and enourage more subscriptions. Medium group is the largest group and this strategy can help increase subscriptions without the excessive cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategies: It was shown that features like contact duration, frequency, and previous sucess significantly impact subscription likelihood. The bank's call center team should keep up their efforts with contacting customers and communicating the banks offers, education and build strong customer relationship. It should create more educational and promotional information for customers with lower bank balance to promote fixed deposit for those who might not be fully aware of the benefits. The chart also showed that timing is also highly important. Seasonal campaign timing which seems to be october appear to influence subscriptions. The marketing team can push during these period to maximize reach and engagement. \n",
    "\n",
    "By implenting the recommendations and insights from this analysis, the bank can efficiently allocate resoures which will improve their goal of term deposit conversions, and in result have profit and more stable cash flow."
